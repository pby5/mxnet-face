Using [MXNet](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet) for Face-related Algorithm
-------------------------
-------------------------
Modify

it is based on code in[tornadomeet](https://github.com/tornadomeet/mxnet-face),thanks for his sharing and I modify some bugs and add other networks due to paper and wu xiang's github code is differnect.
my work is based on CASIA-WebFace while not clean CASIA-WebFace and get '0.9625+-0.0113'accuray on LFW dataset

About
--------
Using mxnet for face-related algorithm, here now only provide a trained lightened cnn[1] model together with the training script, the single model get *97.13%+-0.88%* accuracy on LFW, and with only 20MB size.

How to test
-----------
run ```./test.sh``` in shell.  
This script will run the evaluation on lfw using trained model, befor running, you should change your own ```align_data_path``` in test.sh.

How to train
------------
run ```./run.sh``` in shell.  
This script will train the lightened cnn face model, using [CASIA-WebFace](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/english/CASIA-WebFace-Database.html) dataset, more accurately, i used the [cleaned version](https://github.com/happynear/FaceVerification).  
Again, you should change with your own setting in run.sh, and using your own hyper-parameter when training the model.


Implemented details
----------------------
* you should installed the [dlib](https://github.com/davisking/dlib) and [opencv](https://github.com/Itseez/opencv) libirary with python interface firstly.
* using dlib for face detection and alignment like [openface](https://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/), but you can also choose opencv for detection, i have provided the detection model in ```model/opencv/cascade.xml```.
* using my slightly changed mxnet branch [face](https://github.com/tornadomeet/mxnet/tree/face) for training.
* 385504 images for train, and 20290 for val.
* run ```./model/get-models.sh``` to download the ```shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat``` for face alignment.

How to improve accuracy on LFW?
-------------------------------
* using more accurate aligned face images for trainig, currently the aligned face images for training has many mistake images, which will hurt the perfomance. you can using more powerful face detection and alignment for face processing.
* using more data
* add verification information
* ...
